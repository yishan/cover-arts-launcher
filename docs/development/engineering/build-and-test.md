# Build and Test

Use ESP-IDF 5.5.3. On a clean machine or when the toolchain is missing, follow
the [environment bootstrap](environment-setup.md) first.

> **No original-firmware backup is required before downloading (flashing) new
> firmware to the device.** Reading out the installed firmware is not a
> prerequisite. Flashing replaces the installed firmware and does not provide
> automatic restoration of it. This does not mean user data is preserved: if
> you need existing settings or records, export or otherwise save them first.
> See [flashing and stored data](firmware-layout.md#flashing-and-stored-data).

> Prefer `./tools/validate.sh --firmware` for firmware builds. Flash its
> verified `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-Cover-Arts-Launcher-v1.0.0-full.bin` at offset `0x0` for a blank
> device or an intentional complete refresh. The merged image may reset NVS;
> use segmented `idf.py flash` when existing NVS state must be preserved. Treat
> `idf.py build` and `idf.py flash` as incremental development commands, not the
> default delivery path.

```bash
source <path-to-esp-idf-v5.5.3>/export.sh
idf.py --version             # must report ESP-IDF v5.5.3
./tools/validate.sh --firmware # preferred: build and verify merged 0x0 image
idf.py set-target esp32c3     # fresh checkout or changed target
idf.py build                  # optional incremental application build
idf.py flash monitor          # optional incremental application flash
idf.py fullclean              # remove stale generated build state only
```

`idf.py fullclean` does not fully synchronize an existing `sdkconfig` with
changed defaults. Preserve intentional local settings, then run
`idf.py set-target esp32c3` when the target or tracked defaults must be
regenerated.

### Speeding up repeated builds

ccache can reuse previous compiler results when sources need to be compiled
again. ESP-IDF 5.5.3 disables it by default. After activating ESP-IDF, check that
ccache is available and enable it for an individual build (the same command
works in Linux/macOS shells and native Windows ESP-IDF terminals):

```text
ccache --version
idf.py --ccache build
```

Alternatively, enable it for the current Linux/macOS shell and its child
processes, including the validation script:

```bash
export IDF_CCACHE_ENABLE=1
idf.py build
```

This is an `idf.py` option, not a `sdkconfig` or `menuconfig` setting. For
repeatable project or CI builds, pass `--ccache` explicitly or set
`IDF_CCACHE_ENABLE=1` in that build environment; do not silently edit shell
startup files. See the [ESP-IDF 5.5.3 option definition](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v5.5.3/tools/idf_py_actions/core_ext.py).

Inspect the active cache configuration instead of assuming a fixed path:

```text
ccache --show-config
ccache --show-stats
```

The effective `cache_dir` depends on the ccache version, platform,
configuration, and `CCACHE_DIR`; it is not always `~/.ccache`. Keep it outside
`build/` and temporary validation directories so their removal preserves it.
Cache clearing is not a routine build step. Only when intentionally clearing
the active cache, use `ccache --clear`, which preserves the configuration file,
instead of deleting the directory. This also discards cached compiler results
for other projects sharing that cache. See the [ccache manual](https://ccache.dev/manual/latest.html).

On Windows, real-time antivirus or endpoint scanning can contribute to slow
builds, but diagnose the bottleneck first. For Microsoft Defender, use its
[performance analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/performance-analyzer-reference);
its results are not automatic exclusion recommendations. Exclusions reduce
protection and are optional: obtain user or administrator approval under the
applicable security policy, then limit any exception to the smallest confirmed
scope. Do not routinely exclude the entire ESP-IDF installation, tools tree,
or project, and do not disable real-time protection.

The tracked `dependencies.lock` pins Managed Component resolution. After changing an `idf_component.yml`, regenerate the lock with ESP-IDF 5.5.3, review version changes, and commit it with the manifest. An ordinary build must not leave an unexplained lock-file diff.

Firmware validation uses a fresh temporary build directory and an isolated `sdkconfig` generated from the tracked defaults. It does not consume or overwrite a developer's root `sdkconfig`. Before cleaning the temporary build, it archives the verified firmware and matching debug artifacts, then copies the verified merged image to `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-Cover-Arts-Launcher-v1.0.0-full.bin`. The public artifact name is generated from the product name and the semantic version in `firmware_version.txt`; the gate also rejects a mismatch between that version and the version embedded in the application image. The internal ESP-IDF application files retain the stable `FoloToy-AI-Passport` basename. The gate also validates the [configured firmware layout](firmware-layout.md): image offsets from `flash_args`, partition-table MD5, bounds and non-overlap, and an application that starts in and fits its configured app partition. User-defined partition layouts are allowed.

### Retain matching crash-debugging artifacts

Each successful firmware gate retains a local bundle under
`build/firmware/<full-bin-sha256>/`. Its `manifest.json` records full-image and ELF
SHA-256 values, project/application/IDF version fields, offsets, and each retained
file's size and hash. The archive includes:

- The verified merged image and its application ELF, MAP, and application image.
- `bootloader/bootloader.bin`, `partition_table/partition-table.bin`, and `flash_args`.

Verify a bundle without rebuilding or writing to it:

```text
python3 tools/archive_firmware.py verify <archive-directory>
```

For an existing build directory, `python3 tools/archive_firmware.py create
<build-directory>` performs the same archival checks, but does not run host
tests or prove that the build used the current source/configuration. It is not a
replacement for the gate. The archive tool needs no activated ESP-IDF environment.

The tool checks that the ELF's SHA-256 matches the identity embedded in the
application image and that the retained component images match the merged image.
Use that ELF to decode a crash from the corresponding firmware, not an ELF from
a later rebuild, especially when the version contains `-dirty`. MAP files have
no embedded identity: they are retained with the build and protected by the
manifest checksum. For byte-identical firmware/ELF and other retained files,
repeat archival reuses the first verified bundle and MAP; temporary build paths
may otherwise change MAP contents. Existing conflicting bundles are not replaced.

Extra custom partition images are not retained as separate files. Their payloads
can still be inside the merged image; this is **not** a complete segmented-flash
package or a sanitization guarantee. Preserve any additional matching images
needed for a user-specific segmented workflow separately, after reviewing their
content. Treat `flash_args` as data, not a shell script.

A failed validation may leave a previous `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-Cover-Arts-Launcher-v1.0.0-full.bin`
and older bundles intact. Never present those as the failed run's new output.
Hand off the exact successful bundle path and full-image hash. Hash consistency
is not proof of hardware behavior or a trusted publisher.

`build/` remains Git-ignored. Firmware and debug artifacts can contain embedded
credentials or other private data; do not commit or upload bundles automatically.
Existing CI/release workflows still upload only their configured artifacts, not
these debug bundles; runner-local archives disappear when the runner is removed.
Any additional retention/upload policy needs an explicit content and access review.
No build/archive command flashes a device.

The baseline also has a hardware-independent logic test:

```bash
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Imain \
  tests/test_ui_pixel_math.c main/ui_pixel_math.c \
  -o /tmp/test_ui_pixel_math
/tmp/test_ui_pixel_math
```

Use the unified validation entry point:

```bash
./tools/validate.sh --static    # repository checks, workflows, links, secrets, host tests
./tools/validate.sh --firmware  # build, merge-bin, offsets, and configured layout
./tools/validate.sh             # complete gate; requires an activated ESP-IDF environment
```

CI calls the same script. Fix the shared script or environment if local and CI behavior differs; do not duplicate command sequences in workflows.

Hardware-affecting changes must also run the applicable on-device checklist in the hardware guide. Report compilation separately from physical-device validation.

Never upload the app-only `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport.bin` to the community. Only
the validated `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-Cover-Arts-Launcher-v1.0.0-full.bin` contains the complete checked
firmware layout.
